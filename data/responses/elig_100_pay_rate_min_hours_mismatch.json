Let me walk you through a few options to maximize your eligibility while respecting your needs:\n\n1. **Adjust your rate slightly** — at $27/hr you'd match roughly 40% of available cases.\n2. **Lower your minimum hours** — accepting 25+ hours/week instead of 35 opens many more cases; you could combine multiple clients.\n3. **Target premium or specialty cases** — cases involving specialized care (e.g., dementia, hospice) often pay $28–$35/hr, so your rate fits if you qualify.\n4. **Keep current constraints as firm** — we'll mark $32/hr and 35 hrs/week and notify you when matching cases appear.\n\nWould any of these work for you?",
