You'll also need to submit a short visit note after each shift (just a few sentences about what you did and how the client is doing).\n\nBut here's the thing: the app is designed to be simple, and I can walk you through it right now. Let me do a quick readiness check:\n\n1. **Smartphone**: Do you have a smartphone with you? iPhone or Android?\n2. **App installation**: Have you ever downloaded an app from the App Store or Google Play?\n3. **Text/email**: Can you receive text messages and emails on your phone?",

        "content": "Great — you have everything you need. Let me walk you through what a typical shift looks like with the app:\n\n1. **When you arrive**: Open the app, tap 'Check In,' and it records your location and time. One tap.\n2. **During the visit**: You provide care as normal — the app doesn't need anything from you during the visit.\n3. **When you leave**: Tap 'Check Out.' Same single tap.\n4. **Visit note**: After check-out, you'll see a text box. Write 2–3 sentences about the visit. For example: 'Helped Mrs. Jones with lunch and medication. She seemed in good spirits today.'\n\nThat's it — four steps total. Would you like to try a practice check-in right now so you're comfortable before your first assignment?",

I'll stay on the line while you do it.\n\n...Great, I can see your practice check-in came through! You've got it. For the visit note, try typing a short sentence in the notes field.\n\n...That looks good. You're all set.\n\nIf you ever get stuck, here are your support options:\n1. **In-app help button** — tap the question mark icon for step-by-step guides\n2. **Onboarding support call** — call our support line and they'll walk you through it\n3. **In-person help** — we offer drop-in tech help sessions every Tuesday at the office\n\nI've recorded your readiness level as 'competent after walkthrough' and no additional support tasks are needed unless you'd like to attend a Tuesday session.",
