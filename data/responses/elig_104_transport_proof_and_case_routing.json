Is the car you use insured under your partner's policy, and are you listed as a covered driver?\n3.

Here's the situation: errand-capable cases — which include grocery runs, pharmacy pickups, and client transport — require that we have a verified driver's license and proof of insurance on file. Without those, we can't assign you to those cases even if you're a great driver.\n\nYou have two tracks available:\n\n**Track A: Upload proof** — Get a copy of the insurance policy showing you're a covered driver, and we'll verify your license. Once both are on file, you'll be eligible for all driving and errand cases.\n\n**Track B: Non-driving routing** — We route you to cases that don't require driving. You'd still have a strong pool — roughly 60% of our cases don't require transportation.\n\nYou can also start with Track B now while you work on getting the insurance documentation for Track A. Which approach would you prefer?",

I'll also mark your profile as 'pending driving verification' so we know to upgrade you once you upload the insurance proof. Just send us a photo of the policy declarations page showing you as a listed driver, and we'll handle the rest.\n\nTo summarize:\n- Current routing: non-driving cases\n- Pending: insurance verification (you'll check this week)\n- License: on file, to be verified\n- Errand willingness: yes, once cleared",
