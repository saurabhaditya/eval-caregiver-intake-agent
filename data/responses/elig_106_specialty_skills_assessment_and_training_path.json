Can you describe what kind of dementia care you've provided? For example, redirection techniques, sundowning management, communication strategies?\n2. **Hoyer lift** — you haven't used one. Have you seen one used, or received any training on mechanical lifts?\n3. **Catheter care** — have you ever assisted with catheter maintenance or changing?",

        "content": "That's very helpful, and your dementia care experience is strong — I'll tag you as proficient in dementia care based on your hands-on Alzheimer's experience. That's actually one of our highest-demand specialties.\n\nNow, regarding the other skills and how they affect your eligibility:\n\n- **Hoyer lift**: This is currently in high demand. Without certification, you can't be assigned to cases requiring mechanical transfers. However, we offer a 4-hour hands-on training course that would qualify you. Completing it would open an additional 15–20% of available cases.\n- **Catheter care**: This is a specialized nursing-adjacent skill. I won't tag you for it since you have no experience — patient safety is paramount. If you're interested, we have a clinical skills workshop that covers catheter, wound care, and G-tube basics.\n\nWould you be interested in either training option?",
