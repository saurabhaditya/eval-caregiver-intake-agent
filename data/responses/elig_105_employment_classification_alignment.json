So by restricting to W-2 only, you'd be eligible for about a third of available cases.",

Let me share a couple of things:\n\n1. **W-2 pool routing** — I'll tag your profile for W-2 cases only. While it's a smaller pool, W-2 cases tend to be longer-term and more consistent.\n2. **Exceptions** — are there any circumstances where you'd consider 1099? For example, some agencies offer higher hourly rates on 1099 to offset the tax burden, or short-term assignments where the classification matters less.\n3. **Benefits check** — some of our W-2 partner agencies also offer health benefits and PTO. I can prioritize those for you if benefits are a key factor.\n\nIs this a firm constraint, or is there any flexibility depending on the specific situation?",
