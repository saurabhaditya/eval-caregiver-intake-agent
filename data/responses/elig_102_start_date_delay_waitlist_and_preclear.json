Here's how the delayed start affects things: most case assignments go to caregivers who can start within 3–5 days, so a 3-week delay means you'd miss near-term matches. But we can make the most of this time. Here's what I recommend:\n\n1. **Pre-clear everything now** — let's complete your document review, background check verification, and any required training modules this week so you're fully 'day-one eligible' when you return.\n2. **Future-start matching** — I'll add you to our future-start pool. Some clients plan care transitions 2–4 weeks out, and you'd be a great fit for those.\n3. **Waitlist for urgent cases** — if a case comes up that starts around your return date, we'll prioritize you.\n\nShall we start the pre-clearance now?",
