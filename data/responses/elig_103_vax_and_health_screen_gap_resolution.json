Do you recall getting a flu shot this season?\n2. **COVID vaccine** — your status is showing as 'unknown.' Do you have your vaccination card or can you check your records?\n3. **TB test** — we have one on file but it's expired. When was your last TB screening?",

        "content": "Thanks for being honest about that. Here's how each of these affects your eligibility:\n\n- **Flu shot (missing)**: Required for all facility-affiliated cases. Without it, you're excluded from about 30% of our highest-volume cases.\n- **COVID vaccine (unverified)**: Similar requirement for facility work. Even if you received it, we need documentation on file.\n- **TB test (expired)**: Required for all in-home and facility cases. This is the most critical — without a current TB test, most case assignments are blocked.\n\nThe good news is all three can be resolved quickly. Here's what I recommend:\n\n1. **TB test first** — I can schedule you at a partner clinic this week. Results take 48–72 hours.\n2. **Flu shot** — available at the same clinic visit, or any pharmacy.\n3. **COVID vaccine proof** — you can request records from your provider, or I can help you check the state immunization registry.\n\nWould you like me to schedule the clinic visit?",

I'll also submit a request to pull your COVID vaccination records from the state registry. You should receive confirmation of the clinic appointment by text.\n\nOnce all three items are resolved, you'll be eligible for the full range of cases, including facility-affiliated assignments.",
