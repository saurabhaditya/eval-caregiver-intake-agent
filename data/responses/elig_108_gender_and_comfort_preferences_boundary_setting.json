        "content": "Thank you for being direct about your boundaries. Let me make sure I capture these correctly:\n\n1. **Client gender**: You prefer to work only with female clients — is that right? Does this apply in all situations, or are there contexts (e.g., couples where you'd primarily assist the female partner) where you'd be flexible?\n2. **Toileting**: When you say you don't do toileting, does that include all toileting assistance (transfers, cleanup, catheter) or specifically hands-on personal care? For example, would you be comfortable with a verbal-cue-only toileting situation where the client mostly manages independently?\n3. **Bathing**: Similar question — are you comfortable with any level of bathing assistance, or is all personal hygiene care off the table?",

        "content": "Understood, and I respect those boundaries completely. I won't push on any of them. Let me explain how this affects your eligibility so you can make an informed decision:\n\n- **Female-only clients**: This reduces your pool by roughly 45%, since our client base is roughly evenly split.\n- **No toileting or bathing**: These are among the most frequently requested tasks. Excluding them removes an additional 30–40% of cases from your remaining pool.\n- **Combined impact**: You'd be eligible for approximately 15–25% of available cases, focused on companionship, meal prep, light housekeeping, and medication management.\n\nThe good news is that companionship and meal-prep cases are steadily growing. Here are some adjacent task areas that might broaden your matches without crossing your boundaries:\n\n- **Escort/mobility assistance** (helping clients walk, no personal care)\n- **Errand running and appointment accompaniment**\n- **Cognitive engagement activities** (puzzles, reading, conversation)\n\nWould any of those be comfortable for you?",
